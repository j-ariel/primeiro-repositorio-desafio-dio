[Primeira Parte] 

Bb5  D5                   Bb5
   This world will never be  
  D5
What I expected
Bb5  D5                A5  
     And if I don't belong 
  C5
Who would have guessed it

[Parte 2 De 2] 

Bb5  D5              Bb5 
  I will not leave alone  
D5                Bb5
Everything that I own
 D5                         A5
To make you feel like it's not too late
C5
It's never too late

D5  Bb5           A5 
    Even if I say
C5
It'll be alright
D5  Bb5                   
  Still I hear you say
A5            C5
  You want to end your life
D5           Bb5                   
   Now and again we try
A5          C5
  To just stay alive
Bb5            D5                 
  Maybe we'll turn it all around 
             A5         
'Cause it's not too late
C5
  It's never too late

Bb5  D5               Bb5
    No one will ever see 
  D5
This side reflected
Bb5  D5               A5
     And if there's something wrong 
  C5
Who would have guessed it

Bb5  D5                Bb5   
     And I have left alone 
D5                Bb5
Everything that I own
 D5                         A5
To make you feel like it's not too late
C5
It's never too late
