All My Life - Foo Fighters

All my life, I've been searching for something
Something never comes, never leads to nothing
Nothing satisfies but I'm getting close
Closer to the prize at the end of the rope
All night long I dream of the day
When it comes around and it's taken away
Leaves me with the feeling that I feel the most
Feel it come to life when I see your ghost
Calm down, don't you resist
You've such a delicate wrist
And if I give it a twist
Something to hold when I lose my grip
Will I find something in there
To give me just what I need?
Another reason to bleed
One by one hidden up my sleeve
One by one hidden up my sleeve
Hey, don't let it go to waste, I love it but I hate the taste
Weight keepin' me down
Hey, don't let it go to waste, I love it but I hate the taste
Weight keepin' me down
Will I find a believer?
Another one who believes
Another one to deceive
Over and over, down on my knees
If I get any closer
And if you open up wide
And if you let me inside
On and on, I got nothing to hide
On and on, I got nothing to hide
Hey, don't let it go to waste, I love it but I hate the taste
Weight keepin' me down
Hey, don't let it go to waste, I love it but I hate the taste
Weight keepin' me down
All my life, I've been searching for something
Something never comes, never leads to nothing
Nothing satisfies but I'm getting close
Closer to the prize at the end of the rope
All night long, I dream of the day
When it comes around and it's taken away
Leaves me with the feeling that I feel the most
Feel it come to life when I see your ghost
Then I'm done, done, on to the next one
Done, done and I'm on to the next one
Done, done and I'm on to the next one
Done, done and I'm on to the next one
Done, done and I'm on to the next one
Done, done and I'm on to the next one
Done, done and I'm on to the next one
Done, I'm done and I'm on to the next
Done, done, on to the next one
Done, I'm done and on to the next one
Done, done, on to the next one
Done, I'm done and I'm on to the next
Hey, don't let it go to waste, I love it but I hate the taste
Weight keepin' me down
Hey, don't let it go to waste, I love it but I hate the taste
Weight keepin' me down
Done, done, on to the next one
Done, I'm done and I'm on to the next
