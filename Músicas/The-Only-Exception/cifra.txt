(corda (e) mizinha for afinada em Ré#)

  B
When I was younger I saw my daddy
  F#m6                 E7M
cry and curse at the wind.
     B
He broke his own heart and
                          F#m6        E7M
I watched as he tried to re-assemble it.
     B
And my mamma swore she would
           F#m6        E7M
never let herself forget.
      B
And that was the day that I promised
                   F#m6               E7M
I'd never sing of love if does not exist.
But darling..

Refrão:
 B
You are the only exception
 F#m6        E7M
You are the only exception
 B
You are the only exception
 F#m6        E7M
You are the only exception

 B
Maybe I know somewhere deep in
    F#m6                  E7M
my soul that love never lasts.
     B
And we've got to find other ways
             F#m6                    E7M
to make it alone or keep a straight face.
    B
And I've always lived like this
           F#m6         E7M
keeping a comfortable, distance.
    B
And up until now I swored to myself
             F#m6             E7M
that I'm content with loneliness,

'cause none of it was ever worth the risk.

Refrão:
     B
But you are the only exception
 F#m6        E7M
You are the only exception
 B
You are the only exception
 F#m6        E7M
You are the only exception

( C#m9  B F#6(11) ) (2x)

            C#m9
I've got a tight grip on reality,
                 B                        F#6(11)
But I can't let go of what's front of me here
               C#m9
I know you're leaving in the morning, when you wake up,
          B                                   F#6(11)     E7M
leave me with some kind of proof it's not a dream.

Refrão 2x:

    A9(#11)    E7M               B
And I'm on my way to believing
    A9(#11)    E7M               B
And I'm on my way to believing
