Strapped in the chair of the city's gas chamber
Why I'm here I can't quite remember
The surgeon general says it's hazardous to breathe

(G)
Captain America's been torn apart
Now he's a court jester with a borken heart
He said:
"Turn me around and take me back to start"
(*)I must be losin' my mind:"Are you blind?"
   I've seen it all a million times

  G
Take me down to the paradise city
             C
