She lives in a fairy tale
A5
Somewhere too far for us to find
F#5           C#5      D5
Forgotten the taste and smell
A
Of a world that she's left behind
F#m       C#m  D5   A            A
It's all about the exposure the lens I told her
F#m             C#m D5
The angles were all wrong now
A
She's ripping wings off of butterflies

Keep your feet on the ground
E                    E      F#m E/G#
When your head's in the clouds

Well go get your shovel
    C#m
And we'll dig a deep hole

To bury the castle, bury the castle    (2x)

Her prince finally came to save her

And the rest you can figure out
F#m       C#m  D5
But it was a trick
A
And the clock struck twelve

Well you built up a world of magic

Because your real life is tragic

Yeah you built up a world of magic

                A
If it's not real

You can't hold it in your hands

You can't feel it with your heart
    E
And I won't believe it

You can see it with your eyes
             F#m
Even in the dark
             E
And that's where I want to be, yeah

Well go get your shovel
